Bugs :
1. You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone 
2. pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a
new puzzle

Solve :
1. Only letting the images insert when the selecting element child length are 0
2. Adding a 'while loop' to remove the pieces one by one and adding them back into the puzzle holder
